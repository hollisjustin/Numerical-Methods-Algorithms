# False Position Algorithm
*This algorithm estimated the roots of a function.*

### Inputs
* function being evaluated
* a lower guess
* an upper guess
* a desired relative error
* a maximum number of iterations to be run
### Outputs
* the estimated root
* the function being evaluated at the root location
* the approximate error %
* the number of iterations performed
